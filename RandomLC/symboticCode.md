Given a random list of positive integers, find the smallest \ difference between two integers in two smallest
Another way to think of this is given a linear plane of x coordinates, find the two closest points in the smallest


Input: int[] input:

Goal: Find the smallest difference between the two integers in the smallest

Tracker = minReturn Value

Sort Array List<>

4, 17, 22, 39, 47

4 - 17 = | 13|

minimumValue = 5

4 - 22 = | 18 |

17 - 22 = 

17 - 39 = 


- Array list, 
- Find smallest difference between two integers

- Find two integers that are closesly together
absolute value

- O(n^2) 
- 22 - 4 == 18, 

return int = positive
